# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Developed an advanced credit card fraud detection system leveraging machine learning algorithms. This project involved comprehensive steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation, ensuring robust and accurate fraud detection.
Developed a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning to enhance financial security. The project started with collecting and preprocessing credit card transaction data, ensuring it was clean and ready for analysis by handling missing values and normalizing features. Conducted an in-depth data analysis to uncover significant patterns and relationships, supported by a correlation matrix to identify feature impacts. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to accurately evaluate the model's performance. Implemented a logistic regression model, chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification problems. Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions. The project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning in fraud prevention, providing a robust solution for real-time fraud detection.
